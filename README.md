# HOuKanren

A twist to [uKanren](https://github.com/rntz/ukanren) to support Higher-Order Relational Programming.
 - Unification over beta-eta normal forms
 - More advanced lambda-Prolog features such as implication and unversal quantification are not supported.
 - Higher-order logic programming usually comes with typed terms, which are not supported at the moment

Recnelty, in the miniKanren workshop 2020, [Î»Kanren](https://icfp20.sigplan.org/details/minikanren-2020-papers/7/-Kanren-Higher-order-Logic-Programming-with-Shallow-Embedding) with both implication and forall goals has been published. You might want to check that out.
