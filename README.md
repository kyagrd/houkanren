# HOuKanren

A twist to [uKanren](https://github.com/rntz/ukanren) to support Higher-Order Relational Programming.
 - Unification over beta-eta normal forms
 - More advanced lambda-Prolog features such as implication and unversal quantification are not supported.
 - Higher-order logic programming usually comes with typed terms, which are not supported at the moment
